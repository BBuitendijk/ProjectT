# ProjectT
Setup of a system with a Client Server, NFS Server and a Recovery Server (and a link to S3 bucket).
During my training Cloud Operator at TechGrounds we had a project to create a virtual system including  a Client Server, NFS Server and a Recovery Server (and a link to S3 bucket). After the course the virtual servers we used will be reset. To preserve the code we created for the system, I created this repository.
